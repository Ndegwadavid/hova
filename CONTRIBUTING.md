## Code Contributions üñ•Ô∏è

We appreciate code contributions to help improve the functionality and performance of Hova. Here's how to get started:

### Steps for Contributing Code

1. **Fork the Repository**:  
   First, fork the repository to your own GitHub account. This allows you to make changes without affecting the main repository directly.

   - Go to the [Hova GitHub repository](https://github.com/yourusername/hova).
   - Click the "Fork" button on the top-right corner.

2. **Clone Your Fork**:  
   Once the repository is forked, clone it to your local machine to start working on your changes.
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hova.git
   cd hova
   ```

3. **Create a New Branch**:  
   It's essential to create a new branch for each feature or bugfix to ensure your changes are isolated and easy to manage.
   
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature
   ```

4. **Make Your Changes**:  
   Make your code changes or additions. Ensure that your code follows the project's coding style, and write tests if applicable.

5. **Test Your Changes**:  
   Before submitting your changes, be sure to test your code. If you are adding a new feature, write unit tests or integration tests where necessary.

   - For frontend (React): `npm test`
   - For backend (Django): `python manage.py test`

6. **Commit Your Changes**:  
   Once you're satisfied with your changes, commit them. Write clear and concise commit messages that explain the changes you've made.
   
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add feature X: Description of the feature"
   ```

7. **Push Your Changes**:  
   Push your changes to your forked repository on GitHub.
   
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/my-new-feature
   ```

8. **Open a Pull Request**:  
   After pushing your changes, open a pull request (PR) to the main repository. To do this:
   
   - Go to the "Pull Requests" tab in the **Hova** repository on GitHub.
   - Click the "New Pull Request" button.
   - Select your branch and provide a detailed description of the changes.
   - Click "Create Pull Request".

   The maintainers will review your PR and provide feedback. You may be asked to make additional changes before it is merged into the main branch.

## How to Submit a Pull Request üîÑ

Follow these steps for a smooth pull request process:

1. **Descriptive PR Title**: Ensure that your pull request title is descriptive and clearly explains the change (e.g., "Fix bug with location tracking").

2. **Detailed Description**: Provide a detailed description of the changes you're submitting in the PR. This will help reviewers understand the purpose of your contribution. Include:
   - **Summary of the change**
   - **Related issue number** (if applicable)
   - **Screenshots or gifs** (if applicable)

3. **Link to Relevant Issue**: If your PR resolves an issue, reference the issue number in the PR description using `#issue_number`. This helps to automatically link the PR to the issue.

4. **Code Review Process**:  
   - The maintainers will review your PR and may request additional changes.
   - Please address any feedback promptly.
   - If the PR is approved, it will be merged into the main repository.
